## Description
{In this project, I will be acting as a data scientist working on Financial-Inclusion-in-East-Africa.

# Financial-Inclusion-in-East-Africa
Research project on Financial inclusion in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda

Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs (transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance) delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.

As accountholders, people are more likely to use other financial services such as credit and insurance to start and expand businesses, invest in education or health, manage risk, and weather financial shocks, which can improve the overall quality of their lives.

The World Bank Group considers financial inclusion a key enabler to reduce extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.

Access to bank accounts is an indicator of financial inclusion.

#### The main research problem: Can we predict which individuals are most likely to use a bank account? Provide insight into the key demographic factors that might drive individuals' financial outcomes.
